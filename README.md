# CZip
A project to learn about compression by implementing several different compression algorithms.

## Algorithms
- [x] Run length encoding
- [ ] Sliding window compression (LZ77/LZ78)
- [ ] DEFLATE

## Clients
- [x] CZip.Shell: A lightweight command line utility to compress and decompress files.
- [ ] CZip.Desktop: A desktop GUI client for compressing and decompressing files.
- [ ] CZip.Web: A web-based file storage client. Compression is used server-side to decrease storage costs.
